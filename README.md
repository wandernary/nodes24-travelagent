## Project Overview

This project is a personalized travel itinerary planner with a limited scope of Berlin museums. It combines Langgraph‚Äôs multiple AI Agents architecture with Neo4j graph database. The system allows users to generate optimized itineraries that consider distance, time, and user interests.

This project uses TypeScript as the programming language and Next.js as the framework for building the application. It uses Neo4j as the graph database to store and query relationships between data.

## Getting Started

### Technologies Used

- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) 

- [Langchain JS](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)

- [Langgraph.js](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/)

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### Requirements

- OpenAI API key. Get your key [at OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/)

- Tavily API key. Get your key [at Tavily](https://tavily.com/)

- an instance of Neo4j database (locally or in [AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/product/auradb/))¬†

- Langsmith (optional)

## Installation

Tbd of step-by-step guide for installing the project locally.¬†

### Getting the data for the museum application

Tbd instructions on setting up and configuring the Neo4j database, including getting the data from Wikidata.

The Berlin museum data is from Wikidata, following the example in the [Tomaz Bratanic‚Äôs article about Exploring Pathfinding Graph Algorithm](https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2020/09/01/traveling-tourist-part-2-exploring-pathfinding-graph-algorithms/).

### Configuration

To set config, create a `.env.local` file details, fill in the details from the Neo4j instance and the other keys you've acquired.
